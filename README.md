# 🧠 Go Beyond JavaScript — Golang Discovery Workshop

Welcome to the **Golang Discovery Workshop**, where we explore the power of Go in building fast, simple, and scalable backend applications. This hands-on workshop is perfect for developers with JavaScript/Node.js experience who are curious about what Go can offer in backend development.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Learn Go fundamentals and build a REST API using the [`chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) router — all while comparing concepts with JavaScript/Node.js.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Go installed](https://go.dev/dl) (1.23 or later)
- Basic terminal knowledge

### 🔧 Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/edaywalid/go-beyond-javascrip.git
cd golang-discovery-workshop

# Run the blog API server
cd cmd/blog-api
go run blog.go
```

> 🌐 The API runs on: `http://localhost:8080`

### 📚 Try It Out

Test the following API routes using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl`:

| Method | Endpoint        | Description            |
